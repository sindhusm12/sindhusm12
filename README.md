### 🚀 About Me
I’m a passionate and dedicated *Java Full Stack Developer* with hands-on experience in designing, developing, and deploying full-featured web applications.  
My core expertise lies in *Java, Spring Boot, Hibernate, REST APIs, React.js, and MySQL* — with a deep understanding of how backend systems and front-end interfaces work together to deliver seamless performance.

I enjoy building software that solves real-world problems with efficiency and clarity.  
I have developed and deployed multiple projects involving *user authentication, database management, API integration, and cloud hosting*.  

I always follow clean coding practices, version control workflows, and agile methodologies.

💡 I believe that continuous learning and collaboration are the keys to innovation in software development.
